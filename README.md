This project is a real-time symbol verification system that uses computer vision and deep learning to classify symbols as REAL or FAKE from a live webcam feed. The system first detects and locks onto a stable symbol region across multiple frames, then extracts and preprocesses it before passing it to a trained CNN model for classification. The final prediction with confidence is displayed directly on the video stream, ensuring stable and reliable results suitable for real-time inspection and verification tasks.
